# My Professional Portfolio

## Description
Welcome to my professional portfolio made through react! Upon entering my portfolio webpage, you’ll be greeted with my name and a few tabs that will help you navigate through the webpage in the top right. There is an About Me section giving you a little history about me and some fun facts, my projects that I’m showcasing, my resume page allows you to directly download my resume to your local device, and then a contact page that brings you to a form that you need to fill out to send me a message. Enjoy!
