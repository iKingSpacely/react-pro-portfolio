        <p>I graduated cum laude from DePaul University in 2016 with a Bachelors in Communciations. I majored in Public Relations & Advertising and minored in Marketing. From there, I promptly started a career in Advertising at a media agency named Publicis, known for being recognized as one of the "Big Three" media agencies in the world.</p>
        <p>As I progressed through my advertising career, I ended up switching to the publisher side, joining Twitch, and Amazon owned livestreaming platform for 5 years. Moved up the ranks from Client Strategist to Manager of Client Strategy, creating media strategies for brands across every vertical you can think of. After a time, I realized that it was time for a change of scenery. I wanted to enjoy what I did and be proud of the things the things that I could create either by myself or with a team, not just take get brands/people to buy into something that already existed. This is when I decided to pursue a career in development with the help of Northwestern's Full Stack Development bootcamp. Everything you're seeing on this website is a product of that camp and I truely hope you enjoy browsing!</p>
